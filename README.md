# Kfilter

Kfilter is a small image processing library. Kfilter aims to provide a simple interface to create photo and video filters as you would find in applications such as Snapchat or Instagram. 

![Example GIF](.resources/kfilter_sample_1.gif)

### Why use Kfilter?

* One filter system that works for both photos and videos
* Preview a filter before applying, including swipe to select between multiple filters
* Use a simple builder interface to create filters
* Or write your own GLSL fragment shader to create *any* filter you can imagine

### Why the "K"? 

Kfilter get's it's "K" from Kotlin. Kfilter was written in Kotlin, and is a Kotlin first library. You'll be able to use it with Java, but you'll have a lot more `fun` if you use Kotlin!

## Upcoming Features

* Improved SimpleKfilter builder more options
* Advanced node base Kfilter builder modelled after node based shader editors
* Built in media controls for videos
* A fully fleshed out sample app

## Download

Kfilter uses [JitPack.io](www.jitpack.io) to deploy dependencies. To use Kfilter, add the following to your project and module `build.gradle` files: 
```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		jcenter()
		maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}
```
```
dependencies {
	compile 'com.github.isaac-udy:Kfilter:1.1.3'
}
```

### Special Thanks
This library would not have been possible without the awesome resources provided by [Grafika](https://github.com/google/grafika) and the [Android Media Codec CTS Tests](http://bigflake.com/mediacodec/). 

The [Instagram_Filter](https://github.com/yulu/Instagram_Filter) library also served as a source for some nicer looking default filters.
